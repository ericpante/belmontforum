**Subject: Proposal for a Series on Transdisciplinary Sustainability Research**

Dear Dr Skipper,

Ten years have passed since *Nature*’s September 2015 special issue on interdisciplinarity reinvigorated the debate on how best to break disciplinary silos to address society’s grand challenges [1]. During this decade, sustainability science has evolved from multi- and interdisciplinary collaboration to fully **transdisciplinary** practice—where researchers, practitioners and communities co-define problems, co-produce knowledge and co-implement solutions.

Drawing on the collective experience of the **Belmont Forum**, which has aligned more than €150 million in international funding for transdisciplinary sustainability research since 2009 [2], we propose to guest‑edit a **Series on Transdisciplinary Sustainability Research** for *Nature*. The series would consist of 5–7 tightly connected Comment and Review articles in 2026.

## Series rationale and scope

1. **Looking back to look forward.** A retrospective meta-analysis of completed Belmont Forum projects will trace the pathway from initial problem framing through to measurable societal actions and policy uptake.  
2. **Diagnosing the persistent roadblocks.** We will synthesise the conceptual, institutional and logistical barriers that continue to impede transdisciplinary progress and set out pragmatic remedies.  
3. **Funding transdisciplinarity at scale.** Leveraging unique longitudinal data from Belmont Forum calls, we will distil lessons on how national and international funders can most effectively support mission‑oriented transdisciplinary work.  

## Indicative article slate

| Tentative article | Leading contributors (illustrative) | Central questions / topics|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Epistemological & theoretical foundations | t.b.d. | How has sustainability science moved from multi / inter disciplinary to truly transdisciplinary work? What knowledge types (system, target, transformation) and boundary concepts (co-production, reflexivity, post-normal science) underpin today’s research? Where do equity, power and justice debates sit in the theoretical core?|
| Process design & participatory methodology | Real‑world lab leads (e.g., *Muraille Verte* consortium, *Plaine et Val de Sèvre* living labs...) | What advances in co‑design, living labs and power‑sensitive facilitation have proven most effective? Which tools for managing power asymmetries, conflict mediation and culturally-safe spaces? Metrics for judging the depth of stakeholder involvement (inform, empower)?|
| Systems integration & digital tools | t.b.d. | How can digital twins and nexus models remain transparent and inclusive? Progress in nexus thinking (food-energy-water, land-climate-biodiversity), scenario building, agent-based and hybrid social–ecological models. New data-intensive approaches – earth-observation, AI, digital twins – that allow cross-scale coupling. Trade-offs between technological sophistication and participatory transparency.|
| Governance & transformative pathways | Scholars of transitions and mission‑oriented innovation | How do TD projects translate insight into policy leverage points under multilevel governance and geopolitical constraints? Moving from “knowledge for understanding” to knowledge for action – leverage-points, transition pathways, experimentation, mission-oriented innovation. How TD-SS projects embed in multilevel governance (local to global) and navigate power dynamics & geopolitical conflict. Emerging principles from the 2024 “Five priorities to advance transformative transdisciplinary research” (e.g., deep co-creation, attention to justice, cultivating researchers’ reflexivity)|
| Reflexive evaluation & capacity building | tdAcademy & evaluation researchers | How do we measure societal impact, mainstream reflexivity and build a sustainable TD workforce? Frameworks for assessing scientific rigor and societal impact (formative evaluation, contribution analysis, theory-of-change tracking). Building institutional capacity (tdAcademy, Post-doc Academy for Transformational Leadership, etc.) and supporting early-career scholars. Cultivating lifelong reflexivity – balancing Science, Society & Self – to avoid burnout and mainstream TD practice.|

An opening **Editorial** and closing **Perspective** will frame the series and chart an agenda for the second half of the UN Decade of Action.

## Why *Nature*?

*Nature*’s global reach, reputation for interdisciplinary rigour and commitment to agenda‑setting make it the ideal platform to mainstream the next phase of sustainability science. The proposed series will equip researchers, funders and policy‑makers with state‑of‑the‑art insights and actionable guidance as they confront the intertwined crises of climate, biodiversity and inequality.

## Next steps

If the concept resonates, we would be pleased to provide a full prospectus—including abstracts, author line‑up, timetable and peer‑review plan—at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for considering this proposal. We look forward to the possibility of working with *Nature* to chart the next frontier of transdisciplinary sustainability research.

Sincerely,

Stéphane Blanc<sup>1</sup> and Anne-Hélène Prieur-Richard<sup>2</sup>
